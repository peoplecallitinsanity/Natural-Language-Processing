# Natural-Language-Processing

## NLP Notebooks Overview
This repository contains two Python notebooks that focus on different tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Below is an overview of each notebook:

### 1. NLP1.ipynb
_Description:_
This notebook is centered around web scraping and text extraction from an HTML file. It includes tasks such as:

Task 1: Load an HTML string into Python.

Task 2: Use regular expressions to extract all URL addresses present in the HTML content.

Task 3: Find all color codes within the HTML file.

**Key Functions:**

Parsing and loading HTML data.

Regular expressions (re library) to extract URLs and other patterns.

Writing extracted information (e.g., URLs) to a JSON file.

### 2. NLP2.ipynb
Description:
This notebook is a continuation of the web scraping and string manipulation tasks. It repeats similar exercises, such as extracting URLs from HTML, but also explores additional text patterns, like color codes.

**Key Functions:**

Similar regular expression-based tasks as in NLP1.ipynb.

Additional text patterns and cleaning tasks, including extracting color codes.

**Libraries Used:**

re (Regular Expressions)

json (for storing results)
