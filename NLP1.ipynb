topics, i am releasing this\\nfile, which is geared more towards either the very experienced carder, or the\\nmore advanced thief (for further information on either of these topics, please\\nrefer to my previous files).  my objective with this file is to give you, the\\nevil reader, a basic grasp of what is necessary to make money and not get\\nburned with gems.  and believe me, you can get burned fairly easily.  so if\\nyou\\'re just interested in this for investment reasons, or if you\\'ve carded a\\ngem or four, or if you broke into some house and got a very nice ring, then\\nread on.\\n  ok, i also want to claim full responsibity for the misuses and abuses that\\ncan be learned from this file, i do not care what laws apply to whom in what\\nstate in that part of the country, so on with the file...\\n\\n\\nthis file and carding\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  one of the real difficulties and major drawbacks in any type of credit card\\nfraud is actually making money from it.  and i mean aside from selling the\\nitems you card, since that is relativly risky and high-profile, whereas a\\nsmall bag of gems can be placed almost anywhere, and be of great value.  and\\nbelieve it or not, there are places that do sell mailorder gems (the sharper\\nimage is a prime example, although they no longer to (i was one of their best\\ncustomers too!)).  i would list some, but they tend to

emeralds & rubies: the inside story\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  gemstones, and in particular diamonds, are interesting subjects because of\\nseveral factors:\\n\\n      1. their value is subjective, although the wholesale prices are supported\\n         by the de beers family and the price table is maintained through\\n         advertising and withholding of stones. individual stones are graded on\\n         a subjective basis and as such, the values increase or decrease\\n         abruptly if a further grading session disagrees with the original.\\n\\n      2. gems offer a fairly stable method of converting large amounts of cash\\n         into small, liquid, easily transported possessions.\\n\\n      3. it is still possible to purchase gems in some areas of the world for\\n         substantially less money than in the united states and they can and\\n         are smuggled into the country for profit.\\n\\n      4. synthetic gemstone manufacture and faux substitutions open an area of\\n         easy-to-maneuver and hard to detect high ticket fraud.\\n\\n  the gem and particularly diamond industry operates in a knowledge vacuum.\\nthere are a number of interesting facets, no pun intended, of buying, selling\\nand scanning jewels that people in the jewelry business prefer not to let the\\npublic become aware of. if you are considering purchasing, investing in, or\\notherwise becoming involved with any sort of gem quality crystal, there are a\\nnumber of things you can do to protect your investment.\\n\\n\\ndiamonds\\n~~~~~~~~\\n  for thousands of years diamonds have been a form of decoration, currency and\\ninvestment medium. diamonds have risen in price over the years fairly consist-\\nently with inflation. at some points investment in the right stone would have\\nreturned a much better percentage than similar amounts of stocks, bonds or\\ngold. on the other hand, an investment in the wrong thing or an investment\\nmade blindly because of lack of knowledge, can and in many cases has caused\\nthe buyer to actually lose money.\\n  remember, diamonds are normally sold on a retail basis. this is where you, the\\nconsumer, buy most stones. as one purchases stones of a higher quality and\\nlarger weight, stones that are designed for investment purposes rather than\\nornamentation, it is possible to actually buy at or near wholesale prices.\\nwhen one goes to sell the stone, if one simply walks into a jeweler or new\\nyork-type diamond seller, one expects to lose from the retail price the stone\\nmay have been purchased at.\\n  a number of factors establish the value of a diamond, one of which is the size\\nof the stone. there are certain levels where the value of a high grade stone\\njumps appreciably simply because the stone is over this weight. in general, a\\nlarge high-rated stone is worth logarithmically more than a number of small\\nstones equaling the larger stone\\'s weight. it is, as one would expect,\\nconsiderably harder to find flawless or near flawless large stones.\\n  when the jeweler or professional goes to buy a stone there are several things\\nhe will evaluate in order. generally the stone is graded using the four c\\'s of\\ndiamond grading. these are:\\n\\n    1. clarity\\n                    2. color\\n                                    3. cut\\n                                                4. carat weight\\n\\n  there are established methods and models for grading stones and one could\\nreasonably expect to take a stone of a certain grade from one professional to\\nanother and come out with a similar rating. one should also remember this\\ngrading is subjective and there will be times when two accredited gemologists\\nwill give a different rating, possibly affecting the stone\\'s value, by hundreds\\nor thousands of dollars to the very same stone. it is wise to be able to at\\nleast make a good amateur estimate of the various rating points on your own\\ninstead of having to blindly depend on someone you may not know.\\n\\n\\nclarity\\n~~~~~~~\\n  the first c is clarity. this is not the most important but is generally the\\nfirst item looked at in a stone to be rated. clarity does not refer to the\\nconcept of \"being clear\" with reference to a diamond. clarity refers to the\\npurity of the stone and lack of visible defects.\\n  these defects or flaws or as they are properly known, inclusions, may manifest\\nthemselves as dark, black carbon spots, white carbon spots, small cracks,\\n\"clouds\", feathers, or other areas of visible diffusion within a diamond or on\\nthe surface of the stone itself.\\n  a truly flawless stone, one without any spots, cracks or inclusions, is very\\nrare and extremely valuable. one can expect to find some flaws in most stones.\\nthe type of flaws, size of flaws, and location will have an effect upon the\\nstone\\'s value. it is important to learn how to judge a stone for clarity.\\n  the gemological institute of america (gia) has established a rating system for\\nexpressing the clarity of a particular stone. this rating system is based on\\nthe use of initials and numbers and goes on a one to 10 oriented system\\nwherein 10 would be the best stone and one would be the worst stone.\\n  this system is not expressed in simple numbers but with words and initials to\\nfurther establish the rating scale. the scale is as follows:\\n\\n    10 - flawless - no blemishes can be found.\\n\\n     9 - vvs-1    - no flaws inside the table. possible very small internal\\n                    flaws outside the table. if any external flaws are present,\\n                    must be very minor.\\n\\n     8 - vvs-2    - very difficult to see flaws with 1 0x magnification power\\n                    employed.\\n\\n     7 - vs - 1   - flaws readily seen using 1 0x glass but almost impossible\\n                    to see when the stone is viewed from from the back.\\n\\n     6 - vs - 2   - the back looking down through the stone.\\n\\n     5 - sl - 1   - flaws unable to be seen with the naked eyes but quite\\n                    apparent using 1 0x magnification.\\n\\n     4 - sl - 2   - inclusion may include carbon spots or clouds or feathers\\n                    underneath the table or larger flaws outside of the table.\\n\\n   3-1 - i-1 to 3 - this is the least valuable group. they are heavily flawed\\n                    and the flaws can be determined with the naked eyes. there\\n                    are going to be internal flaws inside the table, maybe\\n                    clouds, groups of carbon spots, feathers and/or cracks\\n                    that can be seen with the eye.\\n\\n                    vvs - very, very, slightly imperfect\\n                     vs - very slightly imperfect\\n                     sl - slightly imperfect\\n                      i - imperfect\\n\\na flawless stone is simply that. no flaw can be found even with the use of a\\n10x jeweler\\'s loupe or 10x microscope. as you go down the scale, the vvs-1 may\\nhave one very small inclusion, generally not in the table (which i\\'ll cover it\\nlater in the file) portion of the diamond but possibly on the edge. again,\\nthis flaw is seen only from the front and only on using 10x magnification. it\\nshould not be visible to the naked eye.\\n  as we get into vvs-2, there may be more than one flaw wlth magnification but\\nthey\\'re still extremely small. one small inclusion may be in the table area of\\nthe diamond.\\n  into the vs grades, the flaws become larger and more prominent than their vvs\\ncousins. vs2 may have larger flaws or a number of small spots possibly located\\nin the table of the diamond that group together and are almost considered one\\nflaw. they are generally in the same area.\\n  when we talk about 10x magnification, this can be in the form of a jeweler\\'s\\nloupe which is a fairly inexpensive must-have item for anyone serious about\\nstones or a step upward which is the two eyepiece (stereo) microscope, which\\nmany jewelers will have on the premises and will let one borrow when perusing\\ntheir stones.\\n  it is wise to always make sure that the magnification device employed is 1ox.\\nthis is the standard and any variation from this will affect the rating of the\\nstone to a great degree.\\n  note that flawless vvs and vs rated stones are rated when looking at the stone\\nright side up with a 1 ox magnification device. if you pick up a stone that\\nsupposedly falls under one of these ratings and you can see inclusions with\\nthe naked eye, you\\'re not looking at a stone that is properly rated.\\n  an sl-1 rated stone will have inclusions that are very obvious under 1ox\\nmagnification, but should still be borderline visible or not visible when\\nviewed with the naked eye. the sl-1 stone may have these borderline visible,\\nsmall dots or inclusions in the table or edge of the stone. an sl-2 rating\\nwill have larger flaws and probably more than one. these will be easily\\nvisible to the naked eye.\\n  in the i grades, the stones can be considered either quite flawed or imperfect.\\nflaws are probably inside the table. there may be flaws of more than one\\nvariety, clouds, cracks or groups of black or white carbon spots will be\\nvisible. this last group of stones obviously are the least valuable and the\\nleast interesting for anyone trying to convert from cash to gems and back\\nagain.\\n  looking backward we can infer several things, the first of which being if you\\ncan spot a number of inclusions without the use of magnification device, the\\nstone is going to be graded 1, whether l-1, i-2 or l-3 is open to some\\nsubjective effort, but it will be an i rated stone.\\n  if you can\\'t find flaws with your eye alone but they do become visible when\\nusing a loupe, one can assume that the stone is an sl rated stone.\\n  the differentiation between an s stone and a vs stone is that in a vs stone\\ninclusions may not be seen extremely clearly even with the loupe. if the stone\\nis turned over and laid on the flat front part (the face of the stone - this\\nis the table) and one views down from the back of the stone where all the\\nfacets come to a point and the flaws are more readily seen here, one can\\nassume it is a vs-2 or above rated stone.\\n  note this viewing is done under white light and with the stone loose.  it is\\nvery difficult to judge any of the 4 c\\'s when the stone is mounted. mounted\\nstones are not generally considered for investment grade purchases. the stone\\nshould be loose and one should be able to turn it freely.\\n\\n\\ncolor\\n~~~~~\\n  the second c used in rating diamonds is color. diamonds come in literally\\nevery color in the rainbow and while a few specialty colored diamonds are\\nextremely valuable because of their deep hues and unique color characteristics,\\nthese are the exceptions rather than the rule. in general, the closer a stone\\nis to possessing no color, that is, to being colorless, the more the stone is\\nworth.\\n  in order to establish the transparency or lack of color in a diamond, the\\nloose stone is placed on a pure white background under a white light. there\\nare special lights sold with adjusted color temperatures for this viewing or\\nsome people prefer to use the soft north sunlight when trying to view the\\ncolor of a diamond.\\n  in color rating as in clarity rating, the dazzling brilliance and fire of a\\ndiamond are the viewer\\'s natural enemy. they will confuse the eye and care\\nmust be exercised to not become jaded or tricked, but rather to view each\\ncharacteristic individually and in comparison to other stones or photographs\\nof stones.\\n  the most accepted color grading system is that again of the gia.  their system\\nis judged by using a series of master stones sold by the gia or their\\nrepresentatives that establish hues and tints and can be laid side by side\\nwith the stone in question in order to view how \"white\" the stone really is.\\n  if at all possible, it is certainly worth one\\'s time to visit a large gem\\ndealer with the intent or apparent intent of purchasing a goodsized stone and\\nask to see a master set and become used to judging the color on several stones\\nuntil you have a feel for the concept of whiteness, transparency and hues.\\n  technology has now produced a practical and inexpensive (comparatively) method\\nof possessing your own diamond master stones. these stones are available in all\\ncolors d through z on the gia scale and are excellent to have on hand to\\ncompare with any other stone you may be considering purchasing in order to\\nrate the new stone. these stones are color correct because they\\'re created to\\nbe exactly the color they\\'re supposed to be.\\n  how can this be cheap? the stones are not diamonds. they\\'re cz\\'s, cubic\\nzirconia. these cz stones look like diamonds, act like diamonds, smell like\\ndiamonds and can be matched to a real diamond in order to compare colors with\\nan extreme degree of accuracy. a five stone set with a color test box is $300\\nfrom:\\n               danley trading corporation\\n               580 fifth ave.\\n               30th floor\\n               new york, ny 10036\\n               800-227-2079\\n\\nthere\\'s also a device known as a color meter which electronically measures the\\ncolor or lack of color in a stone. this meter is quite accurate although\\nfairly hard to come by unless one is a member of the gemological institute of\\namerica.\\n  the gia color rating system has been established using alphabetical\\nnomenclature. the stones are rated from pure (totally colorless) down through\\na sliding scale to yellow, which is the least valuable stone. the gia color\\nrating system starts with the letter d and progresses through the alphabet as\\nshown below to z, which would be very yellow.\\n\\n              a b c d e f  ) colorless\\n                  g h i j  ) near colorless\\n                      k l  ) faint\\n                        m  ) yellow-white\\n                      n o  ) very light yellow\\n                        p  ) light yellow\\n                        q  ) yellow\\n                  r s t u  ) light\\n                        v  ) yellow to fancy\\n                        w  ) fancy\\n                    x y z  ) yellow\\n\\nafter the letter z, indicators are used to suggest the stone is more valuable\\nbecause of its hue; i.e., a \"fancy\" color. as you can see from the above chart,\\nd, e and f stones are considered completely colorless. g, h, i and j are near\\ncolorless stones and take a lot of practice for the amateur to see any color\\nat all, while after j the stones begin to pick up a small tint of yellow that\\nis noticeable to practiced gemologists.\\n  to correctly grade a gemstone, the stone must be loose, not in a setting,\\nshould be on a perfectly white background, should have a white gem quality\\ntemperature light and should be viewed from the rear of the stone. in other\\nwords, the stone should be upside down iying on its table. it is also\\nextremely helpful to have stones of known color grades nearby for active\\ncomparison.\\n  never attempt to judge the color of a diamond when it is set in any kind of\\nsetting, be it earring, ring, or whatever as it is strictly impossible to\\njudge the color of a mounted stone that is taking on hues and tints from the\\nmounting itself.\\n  color is a very important consideration in choosing investment quality\\ndiamonds and, in fact, the differences in large sizes such as one carat and\\nover from a d to an e color (again these are the top rated stones and are both\\nconsidered colorless to the naked eye) can be double the price between these\\ntwo grades. . .\\n\\n\\ncut\\n~~~\\n  bear in mind also that a good diamond cutter can cut a colored stone in order\\nto make it appear whiter than it is when the stone is mounted by doing a\\nshallower cut that\\'s more spread on the point where the facets come together.\\nthis will make the stone appear less yellow, again only after it\\'s mounted.\\nthis is another reason one should never judge a stone that is in a mounting\\nof any sort.\\n  the cut of a brilliant diamond may be the most singular important consideration\\nin buying a stone within a set price range. unless one is an expert and feels\\nhis knowledge is good enough to override general public consideration, there\\nis only one cut to consider and that is the \"brilliant\" cut. brilliant cut is\\na modern cut that is a completely round stone designed with 58 facets to\\nmaximize light reflection and \"fire\" within a diamond.\\n  there are a lot of stones still around which have what is known as a european\\ncut. this cut was done in the 1920\\'s and before and does not compare in value\\nto the modern brilliant cut. the old cut or european cut stones were cut\\nbefore exact ratios and angles were established and understood by the gem\\ncutting society and, as such, do not maximize the reflecting and refraction\\nqualities of the stone. european cut stones such as those purchased at pawn\\nshops and estate sales, are much harder to resell and do not offer the\\nliquidity of a brilliant cut diamond.\\n  there are other popular modern cuts such as the marquise, the oval and the\\npear which attract some buyers when designed for jewelry, due to their unique\\nappearance. these cuts do not reflect as well as the brilliant cut and are\\nrarely seen in investment quality jewelry.  again, the fancier cuts will be\\non the average much harder to sell (definitely harder to sell to a dealer)\\nthan is the round brilliant cut stone.\\n  fancy cut diamonds have fewer angles cut to what is known as the \"critical\\nangle\" and, as such, cannot be as brilliant as a round cut stone. the fancier\\na stone is, the more it differs from a brilliant cut, the greater the loss in\\nlight reflection will be.\\n  another phenomena to be aware of in fancy cut stones such as pear shapes or\\nmarquise shapes, is something called the bow tie effect.  this is a dark,\\ncloudy area across the upper portion of the table on these stones. it is a\\nquality inherent in the cutting and looks like a cloudy bow tie across the\\nreflecting portion of the table. this obviously lowers the value of the stone\\nconsiderably and, if one is thinking about a fancy cut stone, this effect\\nshould be taken into consideration.\\n  fancy cut stones have only two bottom facets as opposed to the eight found in\\nround cut stones to reflect the light back. while they still may appear to be\\nfairly brilliant, the refraction, the fire of the stone, will suffer\\ncritically. this loss progresses from the marquise cut through the straight\\ncuts such as the emerald cut diamond. these straight cut stones suffer a great\\nlight and fire loss and are not nearly as valuable as the same stone would be\\ncut in a brilliant cut.\\n  an uncut diamond is normally sawn or split into two or more stones as decided\\nby the diamond cutter. it just takes a simple error here to completely ruin a\\nvaluable stone and turn it into nothing but dust. now you can understand the\\nhypertension rate among diamond cutters and airport controllers...\\n  once a rough diamond is split, the diamond cutter then decides how the stone\\nwill be laid out and cut. this operation means that a certain portion of the\\ndiamond will be ground off and lost and so this cut plan becomes an important\\nstep in finishing the final stone.\\n  the first step taken by the diamond cutter is to girdle the diamond.  this\\nprocess of girdling establishes the size of the stone and puts a \"waste\" on\\nthe stone (see the diagram). if a stone is poorly girdled, it will not appear\\ncompletely round when viewed with the jeweler\\'s loupe or microscope. a round\\nbrilliant cut stone should be perfectly round and symmetrical.\\n  other mistakes in girdling will produce flaws that manifest themselves as a\\nrazor thin girdle which is prone to chipping or breaking (even though diamonds\\nare extremely hard, they are brittle and can be chipped or shattered in thin\\nareas). a too thick girdle takes away from the brilliance and fire of a stone\\nand indicates a poor job on the part of the diamond cutter.\\n  a diamond cutter cuts (in a brilliant cut) 58 facets all done on exact angles\\nin exact positions in order to let the diamond reflect as much light as is\\nphysically possible. the brilliant cut stone has 16 facets on top and 16\\nfacets on the bottom that reflect the light and give the stone its cut. each\\nfacet is cut on a unique angle and is exactly straight when viewed with other\\nfacets in order to maximize light reflection.\\n  when you view a brilliant cut stone, around the table of the stone you\\'ll see\\nthe kite and the topmain facets. these facets are the areas that allow the\\nlight to come through to the viewer. beneath these you have eight star facets\\nand then 16 upper girdle facets before you reach the girdle itself. beneath\\nthe girdle you have an additional 16 lower girdle facets. all these ancillary\\nfacets contribute to the light reflection through the kite and top main facets\\nand the table portion of the stone.\\n  what is the advantage of the 58 facet brilliant cut stone? what does one\\nexpect to see when viewing a diamond? there are two qualities that make a\\ndiamond attractive to the eye. the first one is known as life and indicates\\nthe amount of light that is reflected back from the diamond to the viewer.\\nthe second quality is known as fire, which is an indication of the amount of\\nrefraction from the facets and split into colors as in a prism effect.\\n  besides the 58 facets, a number of other factors contribute to the perfectness\\nof a brilliant cut stone. the stone\\'s table should be 53% of the area of the\\nstone. while the ratio between the depth of the stone or the length of the\\nstone if you view it from the side, to the spread of the stone which is the\\nmaximum diameter of the girdle, this ratio should be 60% depth to spread.\\n  the angles on a stone must be cut exactly to critical angles. any deviation\\nwill produce a less than perfect reflection of the light waves entering the\\nstone. a jeweler will have special gauges to measure these angles. these\\ngauges are available but they are expensive. or one can buy a loupe that is\\nmarked with angle markings (about $50 from suppliers like edmund scientific).\\nwhen angles are viewed through this loupe, they can be accurately measured .\\n  the first measurement to take is the degree of the angle from the table to the\\ngirdle of the stone. this is known as the top critical angle and should be 34\\n1/2 degrees. underneath the girdle, the bottom angle from the girdle to the\\npoint of the stone is also a critical angle and should be cut at 40 3/4\\ndegrees. a further measurement is that the girdle should be about 1% as thick\\nas the diameter of the stone, although this is not quite as critical as the\\nother measurements and can be judged by the eye after a bit of practice.\\n  a stone which is not cut with the critical angles in the right degree, will\\neither be shallow cut or deep cut and will not reflect the light back through\\nthe center of the stone (the table of the stone) with the same brilliance as\\na stone that is cut to the correct angles.\\n  if the stone is shallow cut, the light will reflect off the edges of the stone\\nbut not through the middle. if it is cut too deeply, the center of the stone\\nwill appear to be dark and it is called \"heavy.\" in the past some cutters cut\\nthe upper angles at a less than 30 degree cut. this \"spread cut\" helps hide\\ndeficiencies in a stone but makes the girdle angles sharp and likely to be\\nbroken or chipped and the stone is not as valuable as a normally cut stone.\\n  if the correct tool for sizing angles is not available, one can estimate that\\nif the table appears to be larger than it should, and the width to height\\n(that is the depth spread ratio) is below 60%, one can assume that the\\ncritical crown angles are shallow.\\n  it is possible to polish a diamond to a high degree to compensate for shallow\\nor deep cut angles at first glance and make the stone appear to be more\\nbrilliant than it, in fact, is. if the stone is chosen for investment quality,\\na measurement of these angles is almost essential .\\n\\n\\ncarat weight\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  the fourth and final c in evaluating a diamond for purchase is the carat\\nweight. the term carat is a reference to biblical times when diamonds were\\ncompared against a carob bean because carob beans tend to have a uniform size\\nand weight. one carob bean became the equivalent of one carat. the carat is\\nstill the primary unit of diamond weight used today. however, a carat is\\nfurther broken down into 100 sub units called points. one point equals 1/100\\nof a carat.\\n  when you buy diamonds it is often mentally economical to break the price of\\nthe stone down to a per carat basis. a rather crude example would be if you\\nwere buying drugs you would break the price of a kilo down into a gram weight\\nto establish what you are actually paying per unit. the same is true in\\ndiamonds. you should divide the weight of the diamond into the price to get\\nthe carat weight.\\n  the next thing to realize is that carat weights do not follow a linear\\nprogression in terms of price. there are certain man-made break points in\\ndiamond pricing. the first break is at .50 (1/2) of a carat. the second break\\nis at 1 carat and then succeeding breaks occur at each carat thereafter.\\n  these breaks, although arbritrary, are valid and a diamond that is .52 of a\\ncarat will cost considerably more than a diamond that is .44 of a carat. a\\ndiamond that is over 1 carat, say 1.03 carats, will cost considerably more\\nper point or per carat than would a diamond that is .94. because this break\\nis so critical, one should always see a diamond weighed in front of one on a\\nscale that has been verified by using an accurate unit of measure. in other\\nwords, put a one gram weight on the scale and see if it actually reads one\\ngram.\\n  because of the price involved, these break points are quite important and one\\ndoes not want to pay the price differential for over a 1 carat diamond for one\\nthat\\'s actually a couple points under. when it comes time for resale, the next\\nbuyer will not be so generous in his consideration of the weight.\\n  these price breaks are very substantial and are one of the few things in\\ndiamond selling that is not subjective. as such they are quite evident in all\\ndiamond sales. the difference per carat weight in a diamond that weighs from\\n1 to 2 carats may be as much as $1,000 per carat or more, on a 2 to 3 carat\\ndiamond. this holds true on a 3 to 4 carat diamond also. one could expect to\\npay not $1,000 more but $1,000 per carat more. this tends to increase as one\\ngets into the heavier weights and good grades of stones because the stones\\nbecome much rarer. it is much easier to find small good stones than it is to\\nfind large stones of the same quality.\\n  wholesalers and for that matter, diamond retailers, buy their diamonds on a\\nper carat basis and if you are going to buy from anyone in the business, you\\nshould consider the stone in that same light.\\n  it is practically impossible to quote diamond prices in a paper like this\\nbecause they are subject to change and market fluctuations.  retail diamond\\nprices are also subject to seasonal conditions and one will find that holidays\\nand gift giving times such as christmas tend to bring about severe prices from\\nretail outlets while the spring and summer months will often evoke a more\\nfavorable estimate from a retailer who needs to make his rent that month.\\n  wholesale diamond prices should not change too much due to seasons or gift\\ngiving times. wholesale prices will vary when the market demands exceed supply\\nand also tend, as with gold, to function somewhat independently and opposite\\nof \"soft\" currency such as the dollar.\\n  the price one pays is determined by how much the seller wants to sell the\\nstone and how much the buyer wants to buy it. obviously in certain situations,\\nstones are cheaper than they would be in a high markup area such as with a\\nretail jeweler.\\n  a stone may come with an appraisal sheet from one of the two gemological\\nsocieties recognized in america. this sheet, as we have seen, details a number\\nof qualities about the stone and will establish an appraised price. a couple\\nthings one should be aware of about appraisals; the first is that they\\'re\\ninvalid generally.\\n  appraisals are an instrument designed for insurance companies to establish a\\npossible price on a diamond that includes a number of factors such as increase\\nin value during ownership. the appraisal sheet will be inflated over the value\\nof the diamond. one never expects to pay full appraisal price for a diamond\\nand if one does, the term \"saw you coming\" falls quite aptly into place.\\n  appraisals also vary from person to person even with accredited gemologists.\\nthe same stone can bring about two entirely separate appraisals that may\\ndiffer in value by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. again, the appraisal\\nis a piece of paper that allows the insurance company to set a value on the\\nstone, not that the insurance company will necessarily pay off the appraisal\\nat full price either.\\n  one cannot make a living by buying diamonds, having them appraised and then\\nreporting them to the insurance company for too long.\\n  appraisals, on a very general basis, tend to be nearly double the price that\\na stone will actually sell for. this is a very wide statement and some\\nappraisals will, of course, be closer to the actual value of the stone than\\nwill others.\\n  appraisals cost money and if you are good enough to sell the qualities of the\\nstone after a little bit of practice, your own word and your own peace of mind\\nwill be more valid than a piece of paper.  you are buying a piece of paper\\nthat someone else may not want to buy.\\n  one should actually consider that one is buying the stone, not a piece of\\npaper telling one how valuable the stone is. this could be compared to buying\\na car because the owner wrote an article about how exciting the car was.\\nneedless to say one should base the actual purchase price on the vehicle\\nitself...\\n  reasons for getting an accredited appraisal are having the stone you want\\ninsured, or when you go to sell the stone, having an appraisal that verifies\\nthe stone\\'s quality to an unsophisticated buyer and that lists the price\\nconsiderably higher than you actually expect to get for the stone, which may\\nhelp sell the stone.\\n  this is a nice line of thinking as long as you are the seller and not the\\nbuyer. this is a buyer beware type of business and you should know what you\\'re\\ngetting and should take all safeguards possible to insure you\\'re getting what\\nyou think you are. if you\\'re buying in a slightly dubious situation and\\nperhaps are not as concerned with the stone\\'s pedigree as some people would\\nbe, you should be prepared to never see the seller again and live or die on\\nyour evaluation of the stone, not a piece of paper from an appraiser.\\n  it should also be pointed out that in certain situations one would not want to\\ntake a stone in to an appraiser. i will leave this to the imagination of the\\nreader.\\n  although appraisals are intended for an insurance company\\'s benefit, one\\nshould realize that if an insured stone is stolen or otherwise destroyed, the\\ninsurance company may want additional information regarding the purchase of\\nthe stone along with an independent appraisal. there are exceptions to this\\nrule. if this stone was a gift or was left to one in an estate, obviously an\\nappraisal becomes the primary instrument of value determination and, as such,\\nis extremely useful to have on hand.\\n  as a sidebar here, there are ways of destroying or damaging a diamond, even\\nthough a diamond is one of the hardest materials known to man. as previously\\npointed out, they are brittle. if you strike a diamond with a hammer, you\\'ll\\ndissolve it into useless industrial dust. if you touch a diamond to an\\nacetylene torch of significant temperature, you will observe an extremely\\ninteresting and costly phenomenon where the diamond turns back into the same\\nblack carbon that it came from.\\n  graphite, in other words. once this happens the only recourse is to hope the\\ndiamond was large enough to burn in the furnace and get some heat because\\nthere is no way of changing it back quite as readily to its crystalline form.\\n\\n\\ndiamond: availability and prices\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  diamonds are found literally the world over from black specimens in brazil to\\nflawless whites in arkansas. unquestionably the largest supply of diamonds\\ncomes from south africa where the mines are owned and run by the de beers\\nfamily and have been for a number of years. the de beers closely guard both\\nthe stones and information about their production.\\n  diamonds are found typically in a type of formation known as a pipe because of\\nits resemblance to a pipe driven vertically in the ground. the top part of the\\npipe normally contains \"yellow earth\" which contains natural stones which can\\nbe fairly easiiy crumbled and separated out by specific gravity and the fact\\nthat diamonds stick to grease. most stones do not.\\n  once the yellow earth pushed from the pipe is used up, the second section is\\nknown as \"blue earth.\" this is a much harder, clay-like material that at first\\nwas thought to contain no diamonds and be too hard to crack open because any\\ndiamonds inside would be smashed by the cracking process. it was later\\ndiscovered this clay-like material dries in the sun or under artificial heat\\nto a consistency that allows it to be crumbled. it does contain as many or\\nmore stones as the yellow earth section of the pipe does.\\n  the de beers have a unique position, more so than any other firm in any other\\nfield of commodities. they literally control the price and availability of\\ndiamonds the world over. they do this through something called the central\\nselling organization (cso). the cso literally controls the sales of almost\\nall gem quality diamonds in the world.\\n  they allow sales in a unique ceremony known as a sight allocation where upon\\na de beers authorized dealer is allowed to buy a certain number of stones\\nthey select, wrap and deliver to him at a price they set. this is not an\\noffering but a take-it-or-leave-it situation and if one leaves too many\\nfinally de beer or cso no longer deals with that particular person. he will\\nno longer be a sight holder. this relationship between the sight holders and\\nthe cso is an instrument to instill fear in the wholesaler who depends upon\\na single supplier.\\n  the cso, in order to maintain its level of prices, buys or guarantees to buy\\nall natural diamonds produced in the world. they do this in order to maintain\\nan exact supply and demand ratio they feel is advantageous to the market.\\n  extra stones are stored in bank vaults, supposedly in london and a few other\\ncountries and only marketed when the supply for them increases. de beers and\\ntheir organization, the cso, do not make public exactly how many diamonds are\\nbeing produced and how many are being released or what the price would fall\\nto if the natural odds of supply and demand took over, rather than the\\nstructured sales organization.\\n  for example, current gem prices are as follows:\\n\\n        prices are approximate current wholesale purchase prices\\n        paid by retail jewelers on a per stone basis.\\n\\n

identification\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  the odds on finding an uncut diamond, unless one happens to be walking on a\\npatrolled, electrified, mined and guard dog guarded beach in south africa,\\nare fairly rare. however, uncut diamonds have a number of characteristics\\nthat lend ease to their identification.\\n  they normally appear as cloudy, white or slightly colored pebbles with a\\nunique coal, greasy feel to the touch as they are excellent conductors of\\nheat. natural diamonds can be dipped in water and will not remain \"wet\". the\\nwater does not stick to the surface. these diamonds do, however, stick to\\ncommon axle grease when passed over them, but most stones will not.\\n  natural diamonds also occur as crystals and normally have at least one side of\\nthe crystal that is flat and appears as a facet. sometimes more than one side\\nwill take on this characteristic.\\n  positive identification of diamonds or other gems is achieved by a number of\\nmore scientific methods. specific gravity is a good place to start. this\\nconcept is very simple. it is based upon the weight of a certain material in\\nrelation to the weight in an equal volume of water.\\n  if the material has a specific gravity of four, it will weigh four times as\\nmuch as with that much water. specific gravity is usually checked by using\\nweighing scales that allow suspension of the specimen. first it\\'s weighed in\\nair, then it\\'s weighed in water. the weight in water subtracted from the\\nweight in air with the quotient divided into the weight in air. this gives\\nthe specific gravity of the material.\\n  most gem materials have a specific gravity of less than four. if somebody\\nwants an accurate but fairly fast method, he can produce a few heavy liquids\\nand bottle them to suit his needs. there are a number of liquids such as\\ntetrabromo ethane and methylene iodine that will work. the first having a\\nspecific rate of 2.95 that can be diluted with kerosene to any gravity one\\nwishes and the second, 3.33. it can be diluted with toluene to produce a\\nseries of liquids of certain gravities in between. leaving the material in\\nquestion in the bottle, you can tell at a glance if correct and what the\\nspecific gravity and the density is.\\n  the specific gravity of diamonds varies slightly depending on where the\\ndiamond came from but will fall between 3.50 and 3.53.\\n  the next reliable indicator used is a scale of hardness indicator. as most\\npeople realize, diamonds are the hardest stone in the world. the hardness\\nscale normally refers to something called mohs hardness.\\n  the mohs scale is a 0 - 10 scale. there is another scale that\\'s 0 -15 making\\nit easier to differentiate between the marginal gems that fall between 9 - 10, but the mohs scale is primarily in use.\\n  hardness simply refers to the ability of one material to scratch another.\\nharder material always scratches a softer material.\\n  the difficulty in making the scratch or appearance does not come into play.\\nsimply the fact that it can be made.\\n  it should be pointed out that the mohs scale does not correlate to the\\nrelative hardness of the materials. in other words, a diamond is not something\\nthat is 10x harder than something that is a 1 on the scale. the scale is\\nsimply there to present a basis on which, when a material is scratched,\\nanother material can be identified as harder.\\n  diamonds are a 10 on the hardness scale. quartz is a 7 on the hardness scale\\nas are most types of tourmaline. most garnets are 7 1/4 on the scale.\\nsynthetic emerald tends to be 7 1/4 to 7 1/2. silicon carbide is a 9 1/4 to 9\\n1/2 on the scale, meaning it will not scratch diamond and diamond will scratch\\nit.\\n  opals begin at 4 1/2 and go up through 5 on the scale while turquoise is 5.\\nrubies are 9 on the hardness scale.\\n  it is also possible to set a piece of gem material between two polaroid plates\\nthat are set so that no light may be seen between them. the lower plate that\\nthe gem sits on is known as a polarizer. the upper plate is the analyzer. the\\npolarizer is fixed but the analyzer is rotated.\\n  if during a complete rotation, the material remains dark with no change, it is\\ncalled isotropic. if it is nonisotropic, it will change from light to dark\\nfour times during a complete rotation. the normal nonisotropic pattern is a\\nsharp cutoff from light to dark, much as extinguishing a fire. by doing this\\nwith a gem, it is possible to establish a refractive index.\\n  however, this is a fairly mind boggling exercise and there are easier ways to\\ntell, at least with diamonds.\\n  all precious stones have bad name counterparts, some of which are better than\\nothers. synthetic stones (or by the correct name \"created gems\") are defined\\nby law as \"chemically, physically and optically\" the same as real gemstones.\\n  they are more expensive than imitation or faux stones which don\\'t have the\\nreal characteristics but they\\'re considerably cheaper than natural stones of\\nthe same variety. as long ago as in victorian times, the french were creating\\nsynthetic rubies, emeralds and sapphires, which is a surprise to some people\\nwho buy estate jewelry thinking it contains a real stone only to find it is a\\nsynthetic stone.\\n  today\\'s methods are definitely more sophisticated and create gems so good that\\nonly trained jewelers and gemologists can tell them apart from their natural\\ncousins... if then!\\n  it\\'s possible to create flaws in a created stone although it\\'s more common to\\nsee created stones being too flawless or too perfect to be true.\\n  manmade diamonds have existed for years although they have primarily been of\\nindustrial quality. scientists have claimed it is impossible to make gem\\nquality diamonds. this is not true. about 25 years ago general electric\\ndiscovered it could make perfect, flawless gem quality diamonds which were\\nimpossible to tell from their natural cousins. they decided not to continue\\nthe experiment in any mass version because it was \"economically unfeasible.\"\\n  in the 1950\\'s the soviets discovered a large diamond pipe in siberia and began\\nproducing gem quality diamonds. in 1962 the csp decided to buy all uncut\\ndiamonds produced by the soviet union as to allow them to be under de beers\\nprice control. they expected that, based on comparisons with their own mines\\nin south africa, the soviets would begin to run out of diamonds in about 1970\\nand, therfore, they could afford to buy all the diamonds they would produce.\\n  approximately once a month, a chartered aircraft lands in london and\\n$50,000,000 worth of diamonds are turned over to de beers diamond trading\\ncompany for the equivalent hard currency.\\n  de beers is not very fond of this arrangement but they feel they must do it\\nin order to keep up the diamond prices.\\n  however, an unusual development occurred to the shock of the de beers. the\\nsize of the soviet shipments did not stop in 1970 but rather increased\\ndramatically between 1970 and 1975, besides which the diamonds seemed to be\\nvery homogenous in character, averaging 1/4 carat, flawless with sharp,\\nangular edges and a slight green tint. the soviet diamonds seemed to be\\nremarkably uniform in size and shape and, unlike their african counterparts,\\ndid not come in a multitude of round, square, flat, triangular or twisted\\nshapes but rather ere octahedons.\\n  coincidentally, the soviets, under some pressure, have admitted they, with a\\ngroup of 1200 researchers, developed a way to manufacture a flawless gem\\nquality diamond. this process was officially developed in the 1960\\'s by one\\nleonoid veres yagin. the soviets claim they are not manufacturing these gems\\nbut they are natural gems that they keep selling to de beers.\\n  american agencies, after numerous requests, were finally allowed to visit the\\nsiberian mine and found it hopelessly inadequate in size and facilities to\\nprocess even more than a fraction of the diamonds the soviets are showing the\\nde beers. the de beers insist these diamonds are natural and deny the soviets\\nhave the capability to flood the diamond market with a virtually unlimited\\nsupply...\\n  besides these man made natural diamonds, there is the problem of cubic\\nzirconia or cz. it is usually sold under a trade name such as zirconia,\\nphyanite and diamonique. technically, cz is not a synthetic diamond but it is\\na crystallization of the chemical zirconia that, when cut, has most of the\\noptical characteristics of a diamond.\\n  cz is not as hard as a diamond and it does have a different specific gravity.\\nit takes 1.70 carat cz to equal 1 carat diamond in weight.\\n  czs, however, in the last few years, have become increasingly close to\\ndiamonds and good czs are impossible to tell from diamonds by the eye. in\\nfact, we had several gemologists look at unmounted cz and unmounted diamonds,\\nand they admitted they could not tell the difference. the only one who did\\npick out the cz with some regularity was because, he said, the stones were too\\nflawless to be diamonds...\\n  hardly a reliable way to judge stones.\\n  as one can see, the potential for fraudulent misuse of cz is quite high and\\nthere have been a number of occasions where people were sold cz instead of\\ndiamonds, turned their diamond rings into unscrupulous jewelers or gemologists,\\nonly to have cz put in the same mountings and returned to them. there have\\nbeen a number of cases of people looking at diamonds in a jewelry store, and\\nwith a quick distraction, replacing the diamond in full view of the jeweler\\nwith a cz and giving that back instead. these will pass on sight.  how do you\\ntell a cz from a diamond? well, luckily technology has come to the rescue.\\nthere are a number of devices on the market that, for under $150, will\\nelectronically test the material to see if it is a diamond or not. diamonds\\nhave unique electrical resistance patterns and cz have their own. these\\ndevices are simply touched to the material in question and will tell if it is\\na diamond or a cz. it is a good thing to have on hand if one plans on dealing\\nin gems.\\n  there are a couple of different systems for forming synthetic rubies and\\nemeralds. one is to use a seed chip of the natural stone and then combine\\nchemicals, heat and pressure to \"grow\" rubies and emeralds. the latest\\nprocesses are known as flux processes, which combine heat and/or pressure to\\nwork on the ingredients composing the gemestone to be synthesized. (the\\ningredients are fairly easy to come by; i.e., carbon for diamonds or beryl\\nfor emeralds.)\\n  these flux processes are designed to produce richly colored stones and almost\\nalways do. they usually have greater clarity than the natural variety although\\nsometimes offer distinguishing inclusions which telltale their origin.\\n  the most famous emeralds are probably chatham synthetics which grow in a\\ngroup of crystals. they were first grown in 1935 by caroll chatham of san\\nfrancisco. the chatham family still grows these gems but doesn\\'t care to\\ndiscuss the process. the chatham emerald sometimes has small spicule\\ninclusions on the face of the facets as a result of the crystal forming\\nsolution.\\n  gillson is another variety of snythetic emerald. there is also a japanese\\ngentleman by the name of kazuo inamora, president of kyoto ceramics, who has\\nthree showrooms in japan and one in beverly hills selling \"created\" rubies\\nand emeralds. these created stones have caught on quite well in other\\ncountries including japan and may or many not catch on here. as you can see\\nby my chart, the price difference between the synthetic and the natural\\nstones is quite great.\\n  once again, we\\'ve had experience with chatham\\'s emeralds and have had a number\\nof gemologists that had great difficulty telling the natural emerald from the\\nchatham emerald. in many cases, they both would have passed off as natural\\nstones.\\n\\n         natural: 1-carat emerald (top quality)  $20,000+\\n        man-made: 1-carat chatham-created

find there are a number of creative ongoing scams. the most\\nobvious, of course, is simply to sell a less valuable stone in a more valuable\\nrating. we have seen, in the case of diamonds, how even though subjective, a\\nsmall difference in the rating can make a large difference in the price.\\nagain, never buy mounted stones.\\n  substitution of less valuable stones is an offshoot of this where colorless\\ntopaz may be substituted for diamonds since most stones are colorless and\\nhave quite a bit of luster. the specific gravity of the topaz qill approach\\nthat of a diamond. of course, it won\\'t pass other tests for a diamond.\\n  yellow quartz is often substituted for a yellow diamond. red spinel is often\\noffered for ruby. the worst examples of this occur in areas where the real\\nstones are found.\\n  \"natural emeralds\" sold on the streets of colombia, peru and brazil are often\\nmade from the bottoms of 7-up bottles...\\n  sometimes diamonds are manipulated by taking a yellow diamond and super\\npolishing it to look white. on occasion oil may be rubbed in to make it\\nwhiter.\\n  obviously the stones should be examined as we\\'ve shown.\\n  burma, india, ceylon, brazil, peru and even hong kong and thailand are\\nnotorious places for substitution of non-gem materials in gem sales.\\n  sometimes cut stones in upper and lower portions are cemented together. this\\nis known as a doublet. it is possible to take two diamonds, the upper portion\\none and the lower of another and cement them together to create one diamond\\nwithout the inherent flaws that the opposite piece had before the fushing\\nprocesss.\\n  it is also possible, and is almost as common, to find the upper portion of a\\ndoublet is genuine while the lower portion is cut from a comparatively worth-\\nless material such as quartz or glass and then glued. if this is done with a\\ngreat amount of skill, it will have the appearance of a single stone. it is\\nlegal to combine things such as diamonds, rubies, and sapphire doublets if\\nthey are not sold fraudulently (hehe).\\n  it is possible to drop the stone in water or acetone and if it\\'s a glued\\ndoublet, the glue will dissolve and the stone come apart. however, if glass\\nhas been used that\\'s been fused to a diamond top, this will have no effect\\nand the fusion must be found by careful, microscopic examination. this fraud\\nis extremely difficult to detect.\\n  a better test is to immerse the stone in a strong, refracting liquid such as\\nmethyelene iodide. this is diluted until suddently one part of the stone\\nbecomes invisible. this occurs when the refraction index of a liquid is the\\nsame as that of the stone and the quartz portion which has a much lower\\nrefraction number becomes invisible, leaving the diamond portion visible.\\nthis is an indication of a double stone. indian jewelers are especially known\\nfor their production of such doublet stones.\\n  for the extremely naive, it is possible to buy a false doublet. here the color\\nof the lower portion is imparted to the upper harder portion but neither party\\nmay be gem quality. this is when a piece of rock crystal quartz, a rather\\ncolorless stone, is used or glued to colored glass or colored stones. in this\\ncase, the top part will take on the color of the bottom part, although neither\\none is a gem stone.\\n  extremely cheap doublets have been passed off by using simple colored gelatin\\nor coloring and quartz or glass and a bit of glue.\\n  besides these tricks designed to use modified stone, there are scams such as\\nexaming a stone or piece of jewelry and having a second made to match and\\nswapping the two. this can be done when someone goes to answer a newspaper\\nad, does not buy it but takes a picture or impression of it. then his friend\\nmakes the phony and goes to \"examine\" the piece and switches the new for the\\nold.\\n  it may also be discovered a stone has been replaced with cz after the piece\\nwas left for cleaning or appraisals.\\n  faked stones mounted in jewelry and then hocked is the oldest game in the\\nworld. the perpetrator runs out of money, offers to leave his precious ring\\nas a security until he can get the money he borrows back to the person. the\\nperson may or may not skip with the stone, feeling he has the $5,000 ring.\\n\\n\\ntools of the trade

severe chemicals or ultrasonic cleaners. if you own\\nan emerald, be careful of it. don\\'t wear it during sports. don\\'t have a\\njeweler clean it in an ultrasonic cleaner as it may shatter.\\n  emeralds also break under applications of heat and should never be in a ring\\nthat is soldered. under ultraviolet light they may fluoresceslightly,\\norangish red to red, or they may be inert.\\n  emeralds come from a number of sources. the best come from colombia. these are\\nthe purest colored and generally the finest stones. the emeralds from brazil\\nare lighter, have more inclusions and are generally smaller than from other\\nareas. zambia, africa, produces some bluish stones and some near-colombian\\nstones. zimbabwe is home to a particular emerald known as the sandawana\\nemerald which is generally small with a rich green color. anything over 1/3\\ncarat is rare.\\n  south africa produces some low-quality emeralds. tanzania produces a few very\\ngood quality emeralds. pakistan has just discovered some high-quality\\nemeralds. afghanistan tends to produce flawed but good colored emeralds. ussr\\ndoes produce emeralds but doesn\\'t like to let them out of the country.\\naustralia produces some dubious quality emeralds and north carolina a few gems.\\naustria and india occasionally produce emeralds.\\n  emeralds are not unusual as the word emerald simply indicates an extremely\\nnice version of a fairly common stone known as beryl. it is possible to buy\\nsomething legitimately called an emerald for about $5 a carat. obviously this\\nis full of flaws, not transparent and so impure in color it looks more like\\njade than an emerald. they would never be sold in a jewelry store but emeralds\\ndo sell on tv and some of the better magazines for $5 per carat.\\n  gem quality emeralds range anywhere from $400 to $18,000 a carat, depending\\nupon their quality. as the stones get larger, they become increasingly rare\\nand sell for considerably more money.\\n  color is a critical factor in emeralds and constitutes about half of the\\nstone\\'s value (clarity 30% and cut 20%).\\n  hue describes the primary color and any other colors in the stone.  most\\nemeralds are green hued with a bluish hue also visible, especially the better\\ncolombian-type emeralds.\\n  tone is the depth or darkness of the color as perceived by the eye.\\n  saturation is the amount of hue present in any given color.\\n  depending upon where the emeralds come from, they can exhibit a wide range of\\ncolor; i.e., bra~ilian emeralds are usually lighter toned and less saturated\\nthan their colombian cousins.\\n  the green in the emerald is caused by trace elements of chromium and/or\\nbandium. if the color is very light green, the stone is more correctly\\nreferred to as green beryl, not emerald.\\n  emeralds are often oiled to help their appearance. normally an uncolored oil\\nsuch as merck cedarwood oil is used. the stone may soak in the oil for several\\ndays and will actually take the oil in somewhat, helping bring out the color\\nand \"wedding\" on some of the dry inclusions, making the stone look better.\\n  if one finds an emerald that is mild in color or has a grayish hue, it is a\\ngood bet to soak it in oil a couple days and it may regain its green color,\\nnot to mention its value.\\n  a more unscrupulous \"improvement\" is to use dye or oil with color in it. it\\nis possible to influence the color of a stone by having it soak up colored\\noil.\\n  other problems with buying emeralds are the fact that there are a  number of\\nstones that look like emeralds and overlap colors. tsavorite, a garnet found\\nin kenya and tanzania, looks quite a bit like emerald and has a pure green\\nhue, although it tends to be a little bit more yellowish and never has the\\nblue hue of emerald.\\n  chrome tourmaline is another stone that looks much like an emerald with a\\nmoderately strong green color. another emerald look-alike comes from africa\\nand is called chrome diopside. all these stones can, and are, sold as\\nemeralds to the unwary.\\n  different emeralds from different areas tend to have individually shaped\\ninclusions; i.e., slight pyrite inclusions are typical of emeralds from\\ncolombia although they can be seen in stones from other sources.\\n  a three phase inclusion that shows up under a 1 ox or stronger microscope,\\nwhich has a distinctly liquid area, a gas bubble in a solid square rock\\ncrystal, salt iying superimposed on each other inside a jagged edged cavity,\\nis typical of emeralds from colombia and proves their natural origin.\\n  tropiche emeralds from colombia sometime exhibit six fine radiating arms of\\nblack carbon inclusions, spoke-like in appearance.  another type of this stone\\nhas six arms of emeralds extending from the center of the crystal with a white\\nshaped wedge area in between. when these stones are cut and mounted, they are\\nvaluable because of their inclusions.\\n  emeralds are subject to not only customs duty but market restraints as there\\nis no oso type organization supporting them. it is possible, if one is smart\\nand has verification equipment, to buy emeralds in other countries, notably\\nsouth america, and smuggle them to america for profit. coincidentally, the\\nareas one smuggles emeralds from are the same areas one smuggles cocaine from\\nand these passport stamps tend to yell search me, search me. some people even\\ngo to the trouble of swallowing and then recovering emeralds although\\nobviously, we do not encourage or advise this dangerous practice.\\n\\n\\nrubies\\n~~~~~~\\n  ruby is a specie of corundum and ranges in color from orange-red to purple-\\nred. it is medium light to very dark in tone and quite strong in saturation.\\nchemical composition of a ruby is al203 it is a hexagonal crystal that often\\ncomes in six-sided prisms, terminated by flat faces.\\n  ruby registers a 9 on the hardness scale and is quite tough, unlike the\\nemerald, and not nearly as subject to breakage. under long wave ultraviolet,\\na ruby will fluoresce red or orange-red to inert and under short wave should\\nfluoresce moderate red to orange-red.\\n  rubies come from a number of areas including burma, which is usually\\nconsidered as the finest source of rubies in the world. the best burma stones\\nare medium dark and vivid red.\\n  thailand produces stones which are a bit dark in tone and range from purple to\\nbrownish red because they have a slight bit of iron in them.  africa (kenya,\\ntanzania) produces stones that are normally highly included although\\nreminiscent of burma in color. sri lanka has occasional rubies but more often\\nsapphires that often mask as rubies.\\n  in the u.s.a., north carolina and montana produce a few stones. australia\\nproduces fairly poor quality stones as does india and colombia, nepal and\\npakistan.\\n  rubies tend to be valued partially by the country of their origin. some rubies\\nnow come with authenticated certificates of origin and the word burma will\\nbring a characteristically premium price even when considered next to a thai\\nruby that may appear identical to the burma ruby under incandescent light.\\n  under fluorescent light, the burma ruby will appear to fluoresce slightly and\\ntake on a deeper saturation. this is a highly sought after quality. burma\\nrubies also have some fine rutile needles that are commonly referred to as\\n\"silk\" that add rather than detract to the attractiveness of the stone and\\nfurther establish it as a burma stone.\\n  in order to establish a country of origin, a certified lab such as the american\\ngemological laboratories in new york, has to study the ruby for body color\\nunder various conditions, fluorescence and inclusions. if a ruby is certified\\nas a top burma ruby, the price may be 1 1/2 or twice what it was as an unknown\\nor as a presumed thai ruby.\\n  rubies from thailand tend to have a brownish or purplish overtone.  those from\\nsri lanka are generally very pink in color and more correctly referred to as\\npink sapphire.\\n  there are a number of ways to treat rubies to improve their color, clarity and\\nultimately, their value. the quick fix method is to dye or oil the ruby which\\nwill help hide fractures, inclusions and improve the color of the stone.\\n  a further refinement of this is a diffusion process where stones are immersed\\nin a chemical bath which contains a number of chemicals including chromium\\nwhich gives the ruby its color in the first place. this color is carried in\\nthe skin of the ruby by the chemicals and actually penetrates the skin. this\\ngenerally produces a light tone and the tone is only a skin which will dis-\\nappear upon repolishing.\\n  the next common treatment is a heat treatment. rubies stand heat far better\\nthan emeralds do and it is fairly gommon to heat both rubies and sapphires\\nwhich tends to improve the color by driving out bluish or brownish tints and\\nwill tend to dissolve the transparency, lessening the \"silk\" inclusions on\\nheavily included stones.\\n  these treatments all are dependent upon temperature, time and cooling rate,\\nbut they will bring about a permanent change in the stone leaving no chemicals\\nor treatment to be removed.\\n  in top ratings, rubies are rarer than diamonds but the actual supply of top\\nstones may vary greatly because of political situations. many stones reach\\nthe world markets because they have been smuggled out of places (especially\\nburma) through thailand and other friendlier countries. there is a fair amount\\nof profit to be made in the smuggling of rubies.\\n  smaller, included or industrial strength stones, are cheaper than their\\ndiamond cousins because they are more easily available.\\n  the rhodolite garnet often approaches ruby in color, although tends to be more\\npurplish than the ruby and less saturated but still are sometimes sold as\\nrubies.\\n  tourmaline also occurs in many color ranges including ruby red and is\\nsometimes sold as ruby.\\n  a new stone called red spinel has a remarkable resemblance to ruby and is not\\noften seen on the market because it is generally sold as a ruby.\\n  rubies have been synthesized since the late 1 800\\'s. there are two primary\\nmethods of synthesizing rubies - the fusion method and the pulling method. in\\nthe 1950\\'s, several manufacturers began flux growing rubies which takes\\nconsiderably longer than the other methods and produces a stone much closer\\nto its natural version.  flux grown rubies tend to be extremely clear and\\ntransparent with an orange overtone.\\n  fusion stones tend to be strikingly flawless looking while the flux methods\\nmay actually produce a number of inclusions resembling silk.\\n  one clue to synthetic rubies is the cut. because the material is cheapsr and\\nwaste is not as much a problem, machine cuts such as square or rectangular\\ncuts are more prevalent.\\n\\n\\njewel identification and theft\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  because each gemstone is unique when considered with all its variables (cut,\\ncolor, irregularities, inclusions, refraction, reflection) it is possible to\\nphotograph a particular stone and record its measurements and ratings to\\nestablish a unique fingerprint that will identify that stone as surely as a\\nserial number.\\n  this procedure is now being carried out on certain stones by certain insurance\\ncompanies and individuals. the cost factor is prevalent.\\n  even if a stone is \"fingerprinted\" and then stolen, there is no centralized\\nsource location that every buyer or even every jeweler or gemologist will\\ncheck before purchasing the stone. this record comes into play more often\\nwhen a stone is recovered and ownership is in question.\\n  there are some exceptions to this rule. stones that are of immense value or\\nhighly individualistic are put on hot lists. organizations such as interpol\\nkeep a record and submit copies of printed information along with any\\nsuspects\\' names to various countries\\' police agencies, and a group called the\\njeweler\\'s security association puts out bulletins and occasionally flashes to\\ntheir various members on particularly bold, large or unusual gem thefts.\\n  the criminal counter to this type of recordkeeping is to immediately remove\\nany stones from their mountings and melt the mountings down for the precious\\nmetal they contain. the stone is then sold individually or mixed in with a\\ngroup of other non-illegal stones and sold in a grouping. as anyone knows, if\\nthe stone is held a while, the \"hotness\" becomes less of a factor in a sale.\\n  large, unusual or famous stones can be taken to a less than honest cutter,\\nwho can cut the stone down into a number of smaller stones. this wastes some\\nof the material as does any cutting procedure and makes the stones\\nintrinsically less valuable as size is a coveted asset in investment quality\\n(or even jewelry quality) gemstones.\\n  in spite of identification and insurance company efforts, jewels still remain\\none of the most highly sought after targets and any jeweler or diamond cutter\\nrealizes he must constantly update his security precautions and it is still\\nprobably only a matter of time before he is hit. insurance rates for these\\npeople are fairly substantial as one would imagine.\\n\\n\\nnotes on information in this
